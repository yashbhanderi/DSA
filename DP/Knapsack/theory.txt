Bag capacity: x

-> So, We have to fill the bag -> With Maximum Profit
-> Some items don't go, or Bag may have some space after process completion
-> But in the end -> We must get max Profit

-> How to find problem is of DP
    1) Choices : We have to chose from multiple Choices
    2) Optimal : We have to find Maximum, minimum, Optimal, Best, Worst anything but optimal


-> DP = Recusrion -> Memoization -> Choice Diagram
                        DP              DP
-> DP = Recusrion + Storage

-> Knapsack method

    If 10 kg capacity
    9 kg full, 1kg remains
    Item = 20 kg, 20 Rs

1) Fractional Knapsack :
    SOOO... We'll add 10kg of that item with price 10 Rs and add into bag

    Which means we took fraction of an item

2) O/1 Knapsack
    Either, We'll takeout some item and -> add 20 kg item
    OR NOT AT ALL
    
    Which means..Either take whole or not at ALL

3) Unbounded Knapsack
    We can take items multiple times
    which we can't do in other cases
